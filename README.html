<h1>DiVinE 2.0</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>DiVinE 2.0 exploits full power of modern x86 hardware and reduces unnecessary
delays in workflow. Employing state-of-the-art parallel liveness checking
algorithm, DiVinE 2.0 offers unmatched scalability on both shared memory and
distributed memory platforms in the range of 2- to 16-core machines and
clusters thereof. Moreover, the tool supports 64-bit platforms out of the box,
allowing it to leverage all the memory available in contemporary systems (and
systems of the upcoming years).</p>

<p>In the current DiVinE release, input is provided in DVE format -- an
industry-strength specification language, as used in original DiVinE Cluster
0.7 and DiVinE Multi-Core 1.x, with plenty of diverse example models, ranging
from simple toys to complex real-world models. There is an extensive model
resource available, <a href="http://divine.fi.muni.cz/">The Beem Database</a>, with large amount of downloadable
models and properties.</p>

<h2>Build Instructions</h2>

<p>This package requires pthreads and a recent g++ (4.1 or later, tested under
4.3.4). You will also need cmake (www.cmake.org, tested with 2.6 -- however,
the configure script could download and compile it for you, just run configure
and answer the question(s)).</p>

<p>After unpacking the tarball, compile the source (the build system
should give you fairly clear indication what's wrong in case of
failure).</p>

<pre><code>$ ./configure
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming, that build finishes successfully, you can try to run the binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./_build/tools/divine help
$ ./_build/tools/divine reachability examples/shuffle.dve
$ ./_build/tools/divine owcty examples/peterson-liveness.dve
$ ./_build/tools/divine owcty examples/peterson-naive.dve
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need to install the binaries, as they are mostly
self-contained. However, to make the tool more readily available, you can
install using:</p>

<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>

<h2>Further usage instructions</h2>

<p>Reference of commandline options is available with <code>divine help</code>, as detailed
above. The most useful invocations are these:</p>

<ul>
<li>run reachability on 8 cores:
<code>./_build/tools/divine reachability -w 8 input.dve</code></li>
<li>run model checking on 4 cores:
<code>./_build/tools/divine owcty -w 4 input-with-property.dve</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There are several example inputs, mostly coming from <a href="http://divine.fi.muni.cz/">The BEEM Database</a>,
distributed with the tool under the <code>examples/</code> directory. These are the files
prefixed <code>beem-</code>. Many more models are available for download in the BEEM
repository.</p>

<h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>If Qt4 development files are available on your machine, a graphical user
interface for the DiVinE Tool will be compiled as part of the build process.
You can run the interface with:</p>

<pre><code>$ PATH=./_build/tools:$PATH ./_build/gui/divine.ide
</code></pre>

<p>Please see online help for further information about using the interface. If
you have chosen to install the tool, you should put it on your PATH, and then
issue <code>divine.ide</code>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>Scalability on 64-bit platforms is inferior to scalability on 32-bit
platforms. If you are running on x86_64 or other similar architecture
which can run 32-bit binaries natively, you can compile DiVinE in
32-bit mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ CXXFLAGS=-m32 ./configure
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>If you have previously run configure, you may need to delete or move
the _build directory out of way. However, using 32-bit mode limits the
size of verifiable models to roughly 3GB.</p>

<h2>Reporting Problems</h2>

<p>The DiVinE project uses Trac for managing problem reports. If you encounter a
behaviour you believe is a bug in DiVinE, please <a href="http://divine.fi.muni.cz/">file a new ticket</a> in
<a href="http://www.darcs.net/">DiVinE Trac</a>. However, before reporting issues, please consider checking
if there is a more recent version available and if the issue has been reported
already (in the latter case, please add a comment to the existing ticket, that
you have encountered the issue, and if possible, any further details you may
know about the problem). Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>Obtaining New Versions</h2>

<p>The latest release is always available through <a href="http://divine.fi.muni.cz/">project pages</a>, section
Download. You could also obtain the latest development snapshot through darcs
(you need version 2.0 or later), which is used for version control:</p>

<pre><code>$ darcs get http://divine.fi.muni.cz/darcs/mainline divine
</code></pre>

<p>When you already have a darcs repository of the project, you can get
the latest changes by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>$ darcs pull
</code></pre>

<p>in the repository directory. For further details on using darcs, please consult
the file "HACKING" in the source tree and <a href="http://www.darcs.net/">darcs homepage</a>.</p>
